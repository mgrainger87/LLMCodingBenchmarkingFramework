Adding an integer to a list in Python doesn't make sense and will throw a \"can only concatenate list (not \"int\") to list\" TypeError.\n\nInstead, the min function should be applied directly on the list 'lst' to find the minimum number.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```Python\ndef min_number(lst):\n    return min(lst)\n```",
